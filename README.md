# Goertzel-Algorithm


The Goertzel algorithm is a technique in digital signal processing (DSP) that provides a means for efficient evaluation of individual terms of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).

Goertzel Algorithm :

I Created a sine wave with multiple frequencies f0, f1 and f2. I added some white noise to it. After that I applied goertzel function to the noisy Signal. Additionally I calculated the probailities of detection of each frequency and plotted the average probabilities versus all frequencies detected.
